First Project - Unit 1 GA

Web-based version of the classic 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game using HTML, CSS, and JS

<h2>How to Play:</h2>
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

Need to complete:
    - When playing Vs Comp Game Mode, JS checks and tracks wins and diagonal double points for both Player (x) and Computer (o). If the board is full (ie: draw OR x places final mark for a win), the computer gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to make its next turn, with no available cells.
    Tried to fix using If statement in compGame(), breaks, seperate isBoardFull() function using .filter() method, but my logic was unsuccessful.
