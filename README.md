Web-based version of the classic 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game using HTML, CSS, and JS

<h2>How to Play:</h2>
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
